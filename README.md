* **dataset:** `iris`, `breast_cancer`, `wine`: These datasets are used to demonstrate classification algorithms.
* **requirements:** `numpy`, `sklearn`, `tqdm`
## AI Algorithms in Pure Python
This repository contains implementations of core AI algorithms built using only pure Python. The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on understanding of AI mathematics and processes, without relying on external machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. Instead, we use libraries like NumPy for mathematical operations, allowing you to dive deep into the mathematical foundation of machine learning algorithms.

* `NumPy`: For numerical computations such as matrix operations, dot products, etc.
* `Pure Python`: The algorithms are implemented with basic Python constructs, demonstrating the core workings of each model.
